### Changes to original

### live 2d App Deletegate- lappdelegate.ts

i created

- initialize
- initializeSubdelegatesV2

becouse its easy to create just one model and pass the canvas. bad news i lost the hability to click on the cog in the corner.

### Live2d App Live2d Manager - lapplive2dmanager.ts

- Change private method and constructor to public method.

- Its important to call from outside in order to handle behavviur.
